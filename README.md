My attempt at an IDE for D, written in D.

This is going to take a while to set up, but I have a lot of ideas for this.

Current Road Map:

* Get a suitable back end ( currently looking at qt)
* Write a front end API for the graphics
* Create a nice Text Editor
* Add D support:
  * Create D projects
  * add internal dub support
  * build D code
* Add support for Syntax Highlighting
* Add support for Code Completion
* Add crossplatform support for "debugging"
